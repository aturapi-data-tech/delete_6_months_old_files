# Specify the directory to search
directory="/path/to/your/directory"

# Calculate the number of days in 6 months
days_in_6_months=180

# Find and delete files older than 6 months
find "$directory" -mtime +$days_in_6_months -type f -delete

Gunakan kode dengan hati-hati.

Explanation:

    Specify the directory: Replace /path/to/your/directory with the actual path to the directory you want to clean.
    Calculate days: We calculate the number of days in 6 months (180 days) and store it in the days_in_6_months variable.
    Find and delete:
        find "$directory": Starts searching from the specified directory.
        -mtime +$days_in_6_months: Finds files modified more than 180 days ago.
        -type f: Ensures only files are considered.
        -delete: Deletes the found files.

How to use:

    Save the script: Save the script as a .sh file (e.g., delete_old_files.sh).
    Make it executable:
    Bash

    chmod +x delete_old_files.sh

    Gunakan kode dengan hati-hati.

Run the script:
Bash

./delete_old_files.sh

Gunakan kode dengan hati-hati.

Additional Considerations:

    Dry run: To test the script without deleting files, replace -delete with -print:
    Bash

    find "$directory" -mtime +$days_in_6_months -type f -print

    Gunakan kode dengan hati-hati.

    Scheduling: Use a cron job to automate the script's execution:

    0 0 1 * * /path/to/your/script/delete_old_files.sh

    This will run the script at midnight on the 1st of every month.
    Caution: Be careful when using -delete as it permanently removes files. Always test the script with -print first.

By following these steps and considering the additional tips, you can effectively manage your disk space and automatically remove old files.

bash curret path

To get the current working directory in Bash, you can use the pwd command or the $PWD variable.

Using the pwd command:

    Open your terminal or command prompt.
    Type pwd and press Enter.

This will print the absolute path of your current directory to the console.  

Using the $PWD variable:

    Open your terminal or command prompt.
    Type echo $PWD and press Enter.

This will also print the absolute path of your current directory to the console.

Example:

If your current directory is /home/user/Documents, both commands will output:

/home/user/Documents

You can also use the $PWD variable within scripts to reference the current directory. For example, to create a file in the current directory, you could use:
Bash

touch "$PWD/new_file.txt"

Gunakan kode dengan hati-hati.

This will create a file named new_file.txt in your current directory.
